 * Abstract
 * --------------------------
 * This application is a proof of concept to demonstrate the capability of the 
 * Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula which can be used to solve for [n]th binary 
 * digit in base16 of pi.
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bailey%E2%80%93Borwein%E2%80%93Plouffe_formula
 * 
 * Executive Summary
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * Originally I was considering using the BBP formula to create a new Proof of
 * Work (POW) system for crypto currencies. With the advent of Proof of Stake
 * however and other anonymizing features of currencies the BBP-Pi POW system
 * would not be enough in itself to create a highly successful crypto currency.
 * 
 * A BBP-Pi POW currency would be more of a novelty of interest to researchers
 * mostly. There is also PrimeCoin which uses a POW system for hunting chains
 * of prime numbers. So although this is an interesting idea it needs more
 * thought before simply creating a POW based on BBP.
 * 
 * This application has been structured in such a way that it could easily be
 * modified for grid computing. This application currently will not focus on 
 * grid payload distribution, but will focus on breaking work items
 * into small specific units which can be easily inserted into a grid pipeline
 * in the future.

 *  
 * Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe 
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * The BBP formula was accidentally discovered in 1995 but it changed the 
 * landscape of our understanding of how to calculate certain numbers such
 * as Pi and e. It uses a series of summations to calculate a hexidecimal 
 * stream of the floating point portion of Pi.
 * 
 * Compatibility and Crypto Currency Considerations
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 * This applicaiton is not compatible with large numbers, so be cautious about
 * overflow.
 * 
 * The GMP library has interesting number generators which could also be 
 * introduced for POW systems.

 * 
 * Parallelization, Test system: 2x Xeon E5520 CPUs, 24GB RAM
 * - Un-Parallelized runtime for 1000 slices (10000 digits) is 11.5 seconds.
 * - Parallelized runtime, 1.25 seconds for 1000 slices
 * 
 * Closing thought - The BBP algorithm is a prime candidate for conversion to 
 * C++ in order to use Accelerated Massive Parallelism (AMP) to facilitate 
 * GPU calculation.
